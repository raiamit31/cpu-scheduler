CPU Scheduling

Algorithms : First come first serve, shortest job first, priority scheduling( pre-emptyive ), round robin.

Requirement to build project on linux
1) GCC
2) GNU make

Linux ---> run 'make' ( without quotes ) in the root dir of the project, a binary will be produced with name 'final'
Windows -----> build on your own ;-)
